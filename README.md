## What is Freelay?
Freelay is a quick and easy website layout and website maker! You cant change the css styles right now, but the css is already in there. I also made it, where the website is already fully responsive. So all you have to do is, add the images, text, and color, but other than that its already done for you! It is also totally free! No account needed and no credit card! I made this tool to help web developers, like me, make websites very very fast and easy! 

## You can help too!
If you want to help support this project you can, by following the instructions down below on how to add new layouts. Just make sure that the layout is fully responsive. And you can add more tools to the web app if you want, just make sure that it actually works first!
